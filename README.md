# jeyamaruthi-DFW-Waze-Database
In this project, we have a dataset that consists of a road map (Lines), counties map (Polygons), WAZE application events dataset (Points). The WAZE database is a collection of traffic events such as delays, accidents, traffic jams, etc. The datasets are of shapefile (.shp) format and will focus on the Texas counties in the Dallas/Fort Worth/Arlington area.
